# Tower Defense only on Java

A game project created by following a tutorial as a base, and added more features that came to my mind

Add ons that I made :
- Background for title, game over, next level and game win
- Differents musics depending on the scenes, and creating the settings scene to change volume
- 9 total maps, each ones having more and more difficuly, and an autosave that keeps the maps you've completed on memory
- Scenes added : Level select, Level Win, Game Win, Tutorial
- When max tier, adding an evolution path for the towers, giving the choice between two evolutions (that change drasticly the gameplay)
